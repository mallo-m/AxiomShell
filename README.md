## AxiomShell

C-based reverse shell server and client with ease-of-life builtin commands

![](screenshots/example.png)

AxiomShell is a simple reverse shell in C, coded with sole purpose of avoiding invoking cmd.exe or powershell.exe to execute commands. It starts from the simple idea that cmd.exe, or at least its core functionalities, can be re-implemented in a standalone binary.
